# Prod/NonProd Example

This example showcases how to design a pipeline that can be deployed arbitrarily to different environments with different
configurations grouped by logical tiers. The tiers in the example are np and prod. This kind of setup helps when you
have cloud accounts that group environments. You could further add more separation if you wanted to install to multiple
regions per environment.
